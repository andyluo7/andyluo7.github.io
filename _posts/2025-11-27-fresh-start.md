Thanks for dropping by. This site will collect build notes, experiments, and write-ups on what I’m learning. Expect posts on:

- Tools and workflows I rely on.
- Project retrospectives—what worked and what didn’t.
- Short notes that future me (and maybe you) will want within reach.

If you’d like to follow along, add the RSS feed in your reader or check back periodically. Here we go.
